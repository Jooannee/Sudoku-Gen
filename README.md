# Sudoku Generator
This Sudoku generator is being written as the Project for my IBDP Computer Science SL IA.
The functionality is, obviously, very basic, but it does work!

## Usage/Installation
- Download the "JAR" file from the most recent release 
- Make sure you have a Java environment (JDK) installed, Examples:
  - [Eclipse Adoptium (JDK 17)](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/)
  - [Oracle Java (JDK 17)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
  - [Amazon Correto (JDK 17)](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/?filtered-posts.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&filtered-posts.sort-order=desc)
- Try to run the "JAR" file by double clicking
- If the previous step does not work, run the following command in a terminal of your choice, replacing "path" with the path of the JAR file on your computer:  
```Java -jar "path"```

## Issue reporting
If you would like to report an issue present in the app or have suggestions for possible features to add,
please do so in the "Issues" tab at the top of the page. Make sure to use the correct label to increase the
likeliness of the issue being fixed.  
I would also appreciate it if you included a small section outlining how a feature may be added or a bug fixed,
if you have the knowledge/ability, however, this is, of course, not necessary.

## Contribution
If you would like to contribute to the code in any way, I invite you to do so, however I will most likely
not accept pull requests with the main build, since the IB would most likely murder me.
